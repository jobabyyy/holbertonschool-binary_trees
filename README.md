		HELLO WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF BINARY TREEEEEEEESSSS 

	In this project we will cover the basics of how a binary tree works.

	This project is contained of 16 questions total, beginning with adding
	nodes and ending with having a perfect binary tree.

	Int this project we will cover these questions 

	- What is a binary tree
	- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
	- What are the 
		- depth 
		- height 
		- size of a binary tree
	- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
	- What is a complete
		- full
		- perfect, and balanced binary tree
